    <h1>English lyrics</h1>

    <p>Are you the food? No, we are the hunter!</p>

    <p>(Crimson Bow and Arrow)</p>

    <p>Not knowing the name of the trampled flower</p>
    <p>Birds that have fallen from the sky tire of waiting upon the wind</p>
    <p>Prayers won't change anything</p>
    <p>Only the resolve to fight can change the present</p>

    <p>You pigs who sneer at our will to step over corpses and march onwards</p>
    <p>Enjoy the peace of livestock false prosperity "freedom" of the dying wolves that hunger!</p>

    <p>The humiliation of entrapment is our cue to counterattack</p>
    <p>Beyond the castle walls lies a hunter killing his prey</p>
    <p>With a surging killer impulse scorching his body, he pierces the dusk scarlet</p>
    <p>With a crimson arrow</p>

    <p>Drawing his bow, he takes after his target; he won't let it escape</p>
    <p>Releasing his arrow, he closes upon it; he won't let it escape</p>
    <p>He bends his bow to its limits, the string on the verge of snapping</p>
    <p>He'll release it, time and time again, until his target draws its last breath</p>

    <p>What truly kills a prey are not tools nor your skills at using it</p>
    <p>But your own sharp killing intent</p>

    <p>We are the hunter -> passionate as flames!</p>
    <p>We are the hunter -> cold as ice!</p>
    <p>We are the hunter -> pour your heart and soul into your arrow!</p>
    <p>We are the hunter -> boldly go forth and pierce through everything!</p>

    <p>(Attack on the Titans.
        The boy from back then will soon take up the sword)</p>

    <p>(Who only laments his powerlessness won't be able to change anything.
    <p>The boy from back then will soon take up the black sword.</p>    
    <p>Soon, one day, he will bare his fangs against fate)</p>

    <p>Ones that could hope to change anything</p>
    <p>Are ones who could bear to abandon anything</p>
    <p>Without bearing any risk at all, how could you hope to attain anything?</p>

    <p>Foolish assumptions they are but mere phantasms right now, we could do with even reckless courage</p>
    <p>The advance guards of freedom betting on their offensive</p>
    <p>Victory to the charging slaves!</p>

    <p>All this absurdity forced upon us are our cue to attack</p>
    <p>Deprived of his horizon, Eren yearns for freedom</p>
    <p>With relentless killer impulse assailing his body, he carries violet to dusk-</p>
    <p>With an arrow from Hades</p>
